# Arkana

> Another Rust Kana app

Arkana is a Hiragana / Katakana / Kanji (eventually) learning CLI app loosely based on Anki. It's similar to a flash-card system of learning.
The application is built by me to help me learn the Rust programming language, and to help me finally remember all the Japanese characters.
Feel free to contribute, star, raise issues, and generally help me through my Rust journey.

## Development
This part can be ignored unless you're willing to contribute. It's a list for me to try and keep focus during late night coding sessions.

### Todo

- [ ] Create 'card' front
- [ ] Create 'card' backside
- [ ] Proper styling (ignore this in the early stages)
- [ ] Menu (easy (single chars), hard (char combinations), and the option to choose Kata, Hira, Kanji, or any combination)
- [ ] Add License
