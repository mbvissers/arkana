# Arkana 🧙‍♀️

> Another Rust Kana app

Arkana is a Hiragana / Katakana / Kanji (eventually) learning CLI app loosely based on Anki. It's similar to a flash-card system of learning.
The application is built by me to help me learn the Rust programming language, and to help me finally remember all the Japanese characters.
Feel free to contribute, star, raise issues, and generally help me through my Rust journey.
